    "As we can see from our classification reports, one metric that is especially low for all three models is recall amongst bankrupt companies. This highlights a frequent problem in classification ML which is known as **class imbalance**. It occurs when one class is significantly underrepresented in the training data, and thus our models are trained really well at \"spotting\" the majority class (which is easy), but really bad at spotting the minority one. This is problematic as our interest is often to predict the minority class (i.e bankrupt companies).\n",

    "What is great about this library is that it is built to integrate with scikit learn, so we can just add the SMOTE transformer onto our Pipelines. The only caveat is that, to do this, we must import the `make_pipeline()` function from Imbalanced Learn (for documentation, see [here](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline.html)). Have a go at changing our Pipelines (add SMOTE resampling as the first step) and then use these to predict on our validation samples:\n",

Regularization is an adaptation on the standard linear regression and essentially works by placing a penalty on the size of the regression coefficients when fitting. This is because large coefficients tend to overfit our model to the training data, so by shrinking them we enable the model to generalize better and improve performance on unseen data. A more detailed description of regularization can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-in-machine-learning-76441ddcf99a). \n",

One key aspect of ridge regression is the `alpha` hyperparameter, which is used to denote the strength of the penalty on coefficient size. A larger value of`alpha` will seek to shrink coefficients more and viseversa. Finding the optimal `alpha` value can be cumbersome, but luckily we can use the hyperparameter optimization techniques learned in Session Five to do this. \n",
